# shooting_occurrences

This repo contains code and output for my paper on Shooting Occurrences in Toronto. A dataset from opendatatoronto containing information about the shooting occurrences in Toronto in each year from 2014-2019 was analyzed and discussed in the paper.

It is organised as follows:\

-inputs holds the datasets used and analyzed in the paper\
